# minimal-cayman

This is a minimal [Cayman](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme) alteration, with a bit more config, and made for jekyll. It natively includes Open Graph, Twitter cards, and OS Protocol metatags. The CSS colors avoid the flashy Cayman colors in favor of something a bit more subtle.

Partly based on [jekyll-cayman-theme](https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-cayman-theme), too.

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/RichardLitt/minimal-cayman

## Usage

Edit the `_config.yml` file according to your own specifications. Also edit the `index.md` to display your own content.

### Compressing images

Put any uncompressed images into `src/img`. Then, run `gulp`: this will compress them and make them better for the web, and copy them to `assets/img`.

If `gulp` doesn't work, run: `npm install`.

### favicon.ico

You'll need to replace this, and the logo, with your own images.
